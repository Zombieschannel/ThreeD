# ThreeD - an SFML-inspired header-only 3D library
This library is still under heavy development. It uses OpenGL behind the scenes. It also depends on SFML for some stuff.

I **do not** recommend using it in this state. There are likely bugs and **many** things will change in the future. Currently, Android is supported and Windows/Linux is supported with GLAD.

Used internally by some of my projects like JustMine 2 and ZLE.

There is currently no documentation on how to use this library.
